HR / Behavioural/ Managerial questions:
• Questions based on  project I included in my CV
• What are my interests?
• Why did you choose ECE as your branch?

#Suggestion_to_juniors:
• Be clear with the concepts taught in digital electronics. 
Having some idea about VLSI (especially the CMOS logic 
circuits) and computer architecture (available on YouTube) 
will give you an upper hand. Think loud during the interview 
i.e., interact with the interviewers, tell them your approach
 for the question rather than the final answer. Last but not 
least stay calm during the interview.
