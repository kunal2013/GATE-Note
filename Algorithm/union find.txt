A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps 
track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of 
disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. A union-find algorithm 
is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such 
a data structure:

Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. 
This can be used for determining if two elements are in the 
same subset.

Union: Join two subsets into a single subset. Here first we 
have to check if the two subsets belong to same set. If no, 
then we cannot perform union.
